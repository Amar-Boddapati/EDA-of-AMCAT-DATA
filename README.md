# EDA-of-AMCAT-DATA
# Exploratory Data Analysis of AMCAT Data.
## Introduction:
The dataset released by Aspiring Minds from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) provides valuable insights into the employment outcomes of engineering graduates. The study focuses exclusively on students with engineering disciplines, offering a comprehensive view of their career trajectories. With around 40 independent variables and 4000 data points, this dataset serves as a rich resource for analyzing various aspects of employment outcomes among engineering graduates.
## Data Description:
The dataset encompasses several key variables, including demographic features, academic performance, standardized scores in cognitive, technical, and personality skills, as well as employment-related details such as salary, job titles, and job locations. Each data point is uniquely identified by an ID, allowing for precise tracking and analysis.
Variables such as Salary represent the annual CTC (Cost to Company) offered to candidates, while Designation indicates the job title offered. Other categorical variables include JobCity, Gender, Degree, Specialization, and CollegeState, providing insights into the geographical distribution, gender representation, and educational backgrounds of the candidates.
Academic performance metrics such as 10percentage and 12percentage offer a glimpse into the candidates' high school and senior year examination scores, while CollegeGPA reflects their aggregate GPA at graduation. Technical skills are assessed through scores in various engineering sections of the AMCAT (Aspiring Minds Computer Adaptive Test), including Computer Programming, Electronics & Semiconductor Engineering, Computer Science, and more.Â¶
Moreover, the dataset includes standardized scores for personality traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness,extraversion, neuroticism, and openness to experience, derived from one of the sections of AMCAT's personality test.These scores provide valuable insights into the candidates' personality profiles and potential implications for their career success.
## Objective:
The primary objective of analyzing this dataset is to gain insights into the employment outcomes of engineering graduates, exploring factors such as salary determinants, geographical patterns in job distribution, the influence of academic performance and technical skills on career prospects, and potential correlations between personality traits and job success. By examining these factors comprehensively, we aim to uncover trends, identify potential biases, and provide valuable insights for career counselors, recruiters, and policymakers in the engineering education sector.
